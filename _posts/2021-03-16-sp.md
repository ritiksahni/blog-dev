# Introduction <a name="introduction">

Spyse is an internet assets registry, Spyse collects information from millions of different digital assets or servers from around the globe and give us access to the data which can be used for any type of enumeration activities, surveys, monitoring etc.


They also provide an API so you are free to do any monitoring, data gathering activities and get everything done on your own machines with the help of API calls rather than relying on the web interface! This is very handy in cases of automation of information gathering. Many famous open source tools and frameworks use Spyse as an option to gather information, all of it is possible through the API functionalities provided by Spyse.
