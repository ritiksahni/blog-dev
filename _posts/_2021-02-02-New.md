This article will cover the mechanisms of __Base64__ encoding. If you're into cybersecurity or programming then you might have come across Base64. These days it's used in a huge number of applications for easy data transmission, encoding etc. We see a bunch of random letters with equals sign at the end and the next moment we try to decode it. Ever thought how those bunch of letters store data?

Let's understand that through this article!

## Base64? What is it?

Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme which is very common on the Internet these days. It is used for easy data transmission, encoding, to embed images in HTML, CSS via [Data URIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs).

It simply represents binary data of 8-bit bytes which is converted to 6-bit bytes for the base64 conversion.

## Getting Technical

Base64 uses the following:
- 26 uppercase letters
- 26 lowercase letters
- 0 to 9 numbers
- \
- +
- = (used for padding)

Base64 is the name of this encoding scheme because it consists of 64 main characters but there is an extra character "=" which is for padding so we can say that 65 characters can be used in this encoding.

Let's take a look at the table below
