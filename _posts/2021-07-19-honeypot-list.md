# What is a honeypot? <a name="what">

In computer security, honeypots are developed to attract hackers to attack internet infrastructure.

**Why attract the bad guys?**

To understand threats, attacks that come from the bad hackers! Honeypots are made attractive to make the infrastructure enticing for hackers to attack.

Honeypots appear like real computer systems and software but in reality, they are there to trap the bad guys. It's a dead-end.

In some cases, they are meant to distract the hackers from the real targets that can be attacked. As the honeypots are dead-ends, hackers don't get anything in return after attacking them.
