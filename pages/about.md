I am a 15 years old cybersecurity enthusiast. I participate in capture the flag competitions and bug bounty programs, I have been acknowledged by several companies and organizations. Besides that, I like to listen to music and read books. I like to study about web application security and actively exploring other niches as well.

I know some Python, C++, Javascript and I got my eJPT certification in 2020.
